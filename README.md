This is the public archive of Black Mage in the Shell at the end of FFXIV's Endwalker expansion. It is hosted at [Black Mage in the Shell (Endwalker)](https://miyehn.me/ffxiv-blm-rotation-endwalker). You can go there to see Black Mage at its full glory.

In the next few days it will also be updated to include some notable fight plans so stay tuned.

If you want to make plans for Dawntrail BLM, go to the original site at [Black Mage in the Shell](htttps://miyehn.me/ffxiv-blm-rotation).

Remember us... Remember that we once lived...
